# pazopanib-MIPD
This is the SHINY APP developed for model-based precision dosing of pazopanib. The APP is adapted from https://github.com/FelicienLL/mapbayr-shiny/tree/main/921-pazopanib, which is using MAPBAYR R package developed by Le Loudec et al for the maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters[1].

The paaopanib PK model inside the Shiny is developed based on routine clinical practice metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients. Details could be found on PAGE2023 abstract (https://www.page-meeting.org/default.asp?abstract=10553).
